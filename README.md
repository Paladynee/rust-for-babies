# rust for babies

Learn Rust but I explain it to you as if you were 5, as verbosely as possible.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository by running

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Paladynee/rust-for-babies.git
```

Then, navigate to the directory:

```bash
cd rust-for-babies/content
```

Then start reading at `_01-hello-world/src/main.rs`.
